# Breast Cancer

*Description:*  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. It accounts for 25 per cent of all cancer cases and affected more than 2.1 million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast start to grow out of control. These cells often form tumours that can be seen on X-rays or felt as a lump in the breast area.

A major challenge in detection is how to classify tumours as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). We would like you to complete a classification analysis of these tumours using machine learning (with SVMs) and the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.  

*Objectives:*  
-Understand the dataset.  
-To build classification models to predict whether the cancer type is malignant or benign.
