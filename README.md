# Breast Cancer
### EN
*Description:*  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. It accounts for 25 per cent of all cancer cases and affected more than 2.1 million people in 2015 alone. It starts when cells in the breast start to grow out of control. These cells often form tumours that can be seen on X-rays or felt as a lump in the breast area.

*Problem:* 
The key challenge is how to classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non cancerous).
